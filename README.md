This is Tico Thepsourinthone's submission for the LifeWay IT code challenge.

### Premise

The premise of this challenge is to create a "profile page" for various star
wars characters in the Star Wars universe.

### Specification

Create a simple single page application that provides the following features:

- A search bar that takes the characters name as input.
- A profile containing the following sectional information for the searched
  character:
  - About Me (height, weight, hair color, date of birth, species information)
  - Films Appeared In
  - Starships Flown

Use [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) to obtain all the star wars data that you need.

Use whatever languages or tech you want -- we are looking for clean, testable
code that demonstrates usage of common design patterns and best practices above
all else.

#### BUT

You will get bonus points if...

- A decent understanding of React is demonstrated
- A decent understanding of Next.js is demonstrated
- A decent understanding of unit/integration testing is demonstrated
- A basic "gateway" api is created to consolidate and proxy calls to SWAPI
- You add cool and creative features not included in the spec

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This
endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead
of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js
  features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out
[the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your
feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

[Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more
details.
